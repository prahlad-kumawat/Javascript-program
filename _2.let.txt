>Cannot be Redeclared
    Variables defined with let cannot be redeclared.


>Block Scope -
    Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.

    ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

    These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

    Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

    Example
    {
    let x = 2;
    }
    // x can NOT be used here
