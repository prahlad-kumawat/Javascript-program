4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
   1. Using var
   2. Using let
   3. Using const
   4. Using nothing

>What are Variables?
   Variables is used to store data. 

>Just Like Algebra
    Just like in algebra, variables hold values:
   ex -
        let x = 5;
        let y = 6;

>The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
>The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

>When to Use JavaScript const?
    If you want a constant value always declare variables with const.



>JavaScript Identifiers
    All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
    These unique names are called identifiers.

    Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

    The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

    1.Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    2.Names must begin with a letter ,underscores and dollar signs.
    3.Names can also begin with $ and _.
    4.Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
    5.Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
    
    Note -
         JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.   

>The Assignment Operator -
    In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.


>One Statement, Many Variables -
    You can declare many variables in one statement.

    Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:
        Example -
         let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;

     Note - 1.A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined. 


>Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables -

    If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.

    The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:

    Example
    var carName = "Volvo";
    var carName; 

   Note -
        You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.

        This will not work:

        let carName = "Volvo";
        let carName;
