Const - 
    The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).
    Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
    Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
    Variables defined with const have Block Scope.

>Cannot be Reassigned
    A const variable cannot be reassigned:
        Example-
            const PI = 3.141592653589793;
            PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
            PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error

>Must be Assigned
    JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:

        Correct
        const PI = 3.14159265359;
        const PI;  // this is valid on let but not Const.   
        PI = 3.14159265359;

>Constant Objects and Arrays
        The keyword const is a little misleading.
        It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

        Because of this you can NOT:
        Reassign a constant value
        Reassign a constant array
        Reassign a constant object

        But you CAN:
        Change the elements of constant array
        Change the properties of constant object

Block Scope -
        Declaring a variable with const is similar to let when it comes to Block Scope.
