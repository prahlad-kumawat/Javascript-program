JavaScript strings are for storing and manipulating text.

You can use single or double quotes:

Example
1.let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes
2.let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes
3.let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";


1.String Length
To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property:

Example
let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
let length = text.length;

The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:

Code	Result	Description
\'	'	Single quote
\"	"	Double quote
\\	\	Backslash

1. \n	 New Line - this is used to create new line.

//breaking line codes - 

A safer way to break up a string, is to use string addition:

Example - 
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello " +
	"Dolly!";

note -You cannot break up a code line with a backslash:
